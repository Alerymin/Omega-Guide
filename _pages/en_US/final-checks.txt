### Checking the STM32 bootloader

We are going to see if the STM32 bootloader is effectively unlocked:
1. Power off the calculator
2. Press and hold 6
3. Press the reset button at the back of the device

If the LED turns red and the screen stays black, everything is fine. You can release 6 and press reset again to go back in the firmware.

If it's not the case, please join the [Omega Discord](https://discord.gg/X2TWhh9) and ask for help.
