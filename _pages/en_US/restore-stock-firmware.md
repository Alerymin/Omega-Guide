title: "Restore Stock Firmware"

Restoring your calculator to stock firmware **WILL LOCK IT** and you won't be able to install any CFW on it, unless you ose a hardware method to unlock it again. We highly advise using the bootloader from any compatible CFW and [install Epsilon from softloader](install-epsilon-from-softloader) to still use the latest versions without locking your calculator.

This page will tell you how to go back to a fully stock firmware and therefore locking your calculator.

1. Open [Numworks' restore page](https://numworks.com/rescue)
2. Put your calculator in Recovery Mode holding 6 and pressing "reset" at the same time

4. follow the instructions to restore stock firmware.
