To determine if your calculator can be downgraded to 18.2.0 or not, you have to know the version before you updated.

### If your system version was between 16.3.0 and 18.2.3 except 16.4.3

Then you are eligible to [Downgrade to 18.2.0](downgrade-18-2-0)
{: .notice--primary}

### If your system version was before 16.3.0, 16.4.3, or an unofficial one (Like Omega)

You are not eligible to downgrade, you can only use an [alternate method](get-started#alternate-methods).
{: .notice--warning}

### If you don't know

You can still follow the instructions to [Downgrade to 18.2.0](downgrade-18-2-0), if you are not eligible, your calculator won't break, the guide will redirect you to [Omega Discord](https://discord.gg/X2TWhh9). You will still be able to repair your calculator with Numworks rescue.
