{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

You need an unlocked calculator. [To unlock it go here](get-started)
{: .notice--info}

This page will explain how to install a CFW on your calculator, assuming it's unlocked

#### What you need

- A PC with a chromium based browser (we recommend using [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) directly)
- An unlocked Numworks calculator

#### Section I - Entering Recovery Mode (if needed)

1. Check the model on the back:
  - If it's n0100, you don't need recovery mode
  - If it's n0110, hold the "6" key and press "reset" on the back at the same time, screen will turn black and led will turn red

If you have a N0120, STOP - nothing here will work for you!
