{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

You need an unlocked calculator. [To unlock it go here](get-started)
{: .notice--info}

This page will explain how to install a CFW on your calculator, assuming it's unlocked

#### What you need

- A PC with a chromium based browser (we recommend using [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) directly)
- An unlocked Numworks calculator

#### Section I - Check Recovery Mode

1. Check the model on the back:
  - If it's n0100, you don't need recovery mode
  - If it's n0110, hold the "6" key and press "reset" on the back at the same time, screen will turn black and led will turn red (if it doesn't and the screen shows "numworks.com/rescue", you need to [unlock your calculator](get-started))

If you have a N0120, STOP - nothing here will work for you!
{: .notice--warning}

You can get out of recovery mode by just pressing "reset" on the back

#### Section II - Choose your CFW

There are multiple CFWs you can install on your calculator, most of them install in the same way. Here are a few of them
