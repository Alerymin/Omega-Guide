### Introduction

There are some cases where you can downgrade and some you can't, this page explains how to know if you are eligible to downgrade or not.

### If you have Epsilon 15 or lower

You don't need to downgrade, just go to [Now What ?](n0110-now-what)

### If you have Epsilon 16 to 18.2.0 (but not 16.4.3)

You don't need to downgrade, just go to [Phi](phi)

### If you have Epsilon 16.4.3 or 18.2.3

You are eligible to downgrade, you can continue normally

### If you have Epsilon 19 or higher

It depends on the version you had before updating

- If you had 15 or lower, Omega, or Upsilon: You can't downgrade
- If you had 16 to 18.2.3 (but not 16.4.3): You can downgrade
- If you had 16.4.3, 19 or higher: You can't downgrade

### And If you don't know

Don't worry, trying to downgrade won't break your calculator.
If you were not eligible to downgrade, after downgrading the calculator will be stuck on Numworks recovery screen and you will be able to update from Numworks website and your calculator will work normally.
