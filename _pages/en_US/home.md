## CFW?

**Custom firmwares** (CFW) are software modifications for the numworks. They allow you to do anything that the Numworks is physically capable of doing, rather than being limited by whatever Numworks allows you to do.

Popular uses for CFW include:

* Running homebrew software and games made for or ported to the Numworks
* Installing apps like emulators
* Installing [KhiCAS](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~parisse/numworks/khicasnw.html), a very powerful Computer Algebra Software
* Installing [others CFW](choose-a-cfw), like [Omega](omega), [Upsilon](upsilon) or [Khi](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~parisse/nws.html)

## What does this guide install?

This guide will:
  + Help you decide whether or not you need to install Phi
  + Install the Phi installer as an external app
  + Install Phi's custom bootloader
  + Help you install any of the cited CFW

## What do I need to know before starting?

* The techniques described in this guide are pretty much in their infancy. **We are not responsible for anything that goes wrong with your device**. There is a slight chance that you might brick your device.
