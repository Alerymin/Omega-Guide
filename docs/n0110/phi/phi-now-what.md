You now have multiple choices. You can:
- Install a custom bootloader and continue using Epsilon >= 16
- Install a custom firmware

# Choice I - Install a custom bootloader

If you wish to continue using Epsilon >= 16 while still being able to install a custom firmware, you can install a custom bootloader :
1. Press 3
2. Press OK to confirm
3. You should see something like this :

The "Write flash" stage can take a bit of time. You'll be put back on the main menu after a second, when the flashing is done.

Press 4, then OK. You should now boot back into Epsilon.

:::caution

If you don't boot back into Epsilon, please join the [Omega Discord](https://discord.gg/X2TWhh9) and ask for help.
