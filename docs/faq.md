# Pre-Installation FAQ

**Q:** *Will this guide void my warranty?*

**A:** No, at least not in Europe. This is a software modification, if NumWorks
refuses you a legitimate warranty claim after that, sue the fuck out of them.

**Q:** *How risky is jailbreaking my NumWorks?*

**A:** Full on hardware bricks are almost impossible. The worst you can get is a
calculator with write protection enabled and an empty flash, which can always be solved
with a hardware mod, but the chance of having that kind of issue is very very unlikely.

**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*  
  
**A:** All you need is a device capable of running a web browser supporting WebUSB. Android
phones can be used with an USB OTG cable.

# Post-Installation FAQ

**Q:** *Is it safe to update Epsilon while having a Custom OS installed?*

**A:** At the moment, NumWorks' installer doesn't check for modded bootloaders, neither does
Epsilon, so yes (unless you don't have a bootloader which is probably not the case).
