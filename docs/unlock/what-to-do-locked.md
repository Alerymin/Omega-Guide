### Introduction

If you are here it's probably because your calculator cannot be unlocked or you don't want to deeply modify it. There is no shame in that.
There are still some things that Epsilon allows you to do.

### Python scripts

Still good to mention, you can get Python games on your calculator, you can find them on [NumWorks' Workshop](https://my.numworks.com/python/). To install them just follow the instructions.

### External apps

Since Epsilon 16 for N0110, or Epsilon 20 for N0120, you can install custom apps, they aren't as powerful as Omega ones but they are good. Find them on [Nwagyu](https://yaya-cout.github.io/Nwagyu/).
There is [a page explaining how to install the apps](https://yaya-cout.github.io/Nwagyu/guide/help/how-to-install.html) with also a way to have more space for apps.
Once you enable exam mode or press "RESET" they will be disabled.

### Userland

Epsilon is still partially open-source, you can modify the code to create your own version and install it, however it's userland only and if you reset it will be removed and you are back to stock. You will also have a popup telling you that you are running a modified software.
Note that since Epsilon 16, sharing a modified version is illegal. You should never share the version you created yourself.
