### Requiered reading

The hardware unlock way requieres special tools.

The goal is to force recovery mode to allow installation, your calculator should show a black screen and a red LED.

### Select a method

There are multiple methods.

We recommend [this post](https://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=113&t=25191&p=263495), it is very complete and will guide you very well.

If you have another way to get Recovery mode, you can follow it instead. **We are not responsible for anything that goes wrong with your device**
