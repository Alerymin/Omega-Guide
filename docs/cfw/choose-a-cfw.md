There are multiple Custom OSs you can install on your calculator, most of them install in the same way. Here are a few of them

|           OS                | Advantages                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Omega](./omega)     | The most popular Custom OS for Numworks, forked from Epsilon 15.5.0. It bings back symbolic calculation, allows installing external apps, and adds Python libraries   |
| [Upsilon](./upsilon) | Forked from Omega, Upsilon brings more features and conveience compared to Omega, like a LaTeX reader, more storage for Python scripts, and a better bootloader |
