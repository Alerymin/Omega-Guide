| CFW                | Advantages                                                                                                                                                      |

| [Omega](omega)     | The most popular CFW for Numworks, forked from Epsilon 15.5.0. It bings back symbolic calculation, allows installing external apps, and adds Python libraries   |
| [Upsilon(upsilon)] | Forked from Omega, Upsilon brings more features and conveience compared to Omega, like a LaTeX reader, more storage for Python scripts, and a better bootloader |
