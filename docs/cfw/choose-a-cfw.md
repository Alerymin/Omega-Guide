You need an unlocked calculator. [To unlock it go here](/docs/intro).

:::

There are multiple Custom OSes you can install on your calculator, most of them install in the same way. Here are a few of them:

|           OS                | Advantages                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Omega](/docs/cfw/omega)     | The most popular Custom OS for Numworks, forked from Epsilon 15.5.0. It brings back symbolic calculation, allows installing external apps, and adds Python libraries.   |
| [Upsilon](/docs/cfw/upsilon) | Forked from Omega, Upsilon brings more features and convenience compared to Omega, like a LaTeX reader, more storage for Python scripts, and a better bootloader. |
