Restoring your calculator to stock firmware **WILL LOCK IT** and you won't be able to install any Custom OS on it ever again, unless you use a hardware method to unlock it again. We highly advise using the bootloader from any compatible Custom OS and [install Epsilon from softloader](/docs/cfw/install-epsilon-from-softloader) to still use the latest versions without locking your calculator.

:::


This page will tell you how to go back to a fully stock firmware and therefore locking your calculator.

1. Open [Numworks' restore page](https://numworks.com/rescue)
2. Put your calculator in Recovery Mode holding 6 and pressing "reset" at the same time
3. Plug your calculator in your computer
4. follow the instructions to restore stock firmware.

You now have a fully stock Numworks calculator.
